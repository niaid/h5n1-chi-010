The run numbering scheme is as follows: 

"R1":  Predictors = sex + age + flow patterns + gene patterns
Cohort = All

"R2":  Predictors = sex + age + flow patterns + gene patterns
Cohort = NEG

"R3": Predictors = sex + age + flow patterns + gene patterns
Cohort = POS (without subject 44)

"R4": Predictors = sex + age + flow patterns + gene patterns
Cohort = NONADJ

"R5": Predictors = sex + age + flow patterns + gene patterns
Cohort = ADJ (without subject 44)

"R6": Predictors = sex + age + flow baseline + gene baseline (whole blood + pbmcs)
Cohort = NEG

"R7": Predictors = sex + age + flow baseline + gene baseline (whole blood + pbmcs)
Cohort = NONADJ

"R8": Predictors = sex + age + SOMAscan baseline
Cohort = ADJ (without subject 44)

"R9": Predictors = sex + age + SOMAscan baseline + cell subset counts/ratios
Cohort = ADJ (without subject 44)
